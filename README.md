## E-commerce Website,                                                                                                  05/2020 - 06/2020
-	Implemented a clothing shopping website to allow users to register, sign in, browse items, add items to shopping cart, delete items from shopping cart and check out 
-	Developed frontend by utilizing ReactJS library to build reusable components, with React features including Redux, Redux Thunk, Redux Saga, Hooks, React Router, ContextAPI, Suspense and React Lazy, like managing internal state using Redux to handle complex data sharing in the app
- Designed HTML styling using SASS and Styled components to modularize styling of each component
-	Integrated Firebase’s NoSQL database to store/register user, with Google user-authentication included, and stored cart and purchase information and optimized state persistence 
-	Integrated credit card payments with Stripe API by leveraging React Stripe Checkout Component libaray in the front end and set up a payment route on backend Express server to enable a secrete key to be passed safely to Stripe service
-	Practiced using GraphQL with Apollo to replace REST backend server to enhance performance and avoid over fetching data
-	Deployed the website on Heroku web server (https://crwn-live-jy.herokuapp.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
